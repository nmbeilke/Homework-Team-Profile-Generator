# Homework-Team-Profile-Generator
CLI app to create team profile web pages. OOP practice with Node.js and testing with Jest 

We were given the following acceptance criteria:
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
- **What was your motivation?**
```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to practice Object Oriented Programming and testing. A command-line application was a simple way to take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then quickly generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows a user to manage information about a team.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to work with classes and OOP methods as well as how to run tests with Jest.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
Writing the tests.
  
 ## Installation 
 Make sure to do an "npm install" before running this application. Run "npm run test" to test and "npm run reset" to reset the app and remove the sample HTML file.
 
 ## Usage
 Link to watch application running: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/EzapB5kURusjDd2HKUVS
 Run this with  "node index.js" in the command line, Then you can simply answer the prompts to create the HTML file.
